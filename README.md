# C# .NET 7 Polly Fault Handling/Resiliency/Retry Policy/Circuit Breaker

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of fault handling, resiliency, retry policies, and circuit breakers in C# .NET 7 using Polly, a .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library.

### Features

- **Fault Handling**: Handle transient faults gracefully to improve application robustness.
- **Resiliency**: Ensure the system continues to function in the presence of faults.
- **Retry Policies**: Define and apply retry policies for handling transient faults.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents the system from making calls that are likely to fail.
